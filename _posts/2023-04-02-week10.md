After submitting our design for the flyer, we got a lot of positive feedback as well as some edits before we settle on a final version. However, we also got a code related issue assigned to us as well, which is exciting! <!--more--> We are meeting with the team that's been working on the specific task which involves adding a new component to display information in a table like format. In the meantime, we are excited to take it on and have set up our development environment per their instructions.
