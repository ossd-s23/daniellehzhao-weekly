title: Week 3 - Git and First Group Works
---

### Git Activity
 
 Although I have used git before and have had experience working with these commands, it has been a while and I appreciate the refresher. I enjoyed the guided activity and it reinforced some of the ideas about version control that have become fuzzy: for example, I haven't used remotes/forks very often so my understanding of the work flow wasn't very clear, but the diagram that professor drew on the board was really helpful visually. Additionally, it was helpful to know these commands for the group project.

 ### Browser Extension Work

 Originally, our groups idea to do a browser extension was to allow the user to choose color themes based on a dropdown menu with the options being the colors of the rainbow. However, we found it difficult to change the background colors of many websites because of discrepancies in the naming conventions in each websites' code. Thus, we switched ideas to something more local - give the user an option to write down some notes about a webpage and change the theme/color of that note.

 My first idea about changing the color themes was a step in the right direction, but the execution was out of our capacity to finish by Feb 12. Honestly, I would have liked to make more contributions to the code itself but I found that the work my group members made earlier in the week was sufficient and worked well for the notes browser extension idea.
