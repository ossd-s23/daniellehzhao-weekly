title: Week 4 - Project Reflection
---

The project to make a browser extension was a cool opportunity to work in a group on something useful and/or creative. My group had a good dynamic and was open to changes/adapting when needed. Communication is really important to facilitating a positive and collaborative dynamic and I think we did that well. However, we could have used a better platform for communication besides email. My own contributions were building extra features on top of the framework such as the clear button. I have used Javascript before so it wasn't foreign to me but understanding the structure of building the browser extension was new. I really enjoyed the Youtube browser extension and thought it had so many cool features that I would actually use for myself. They put a lot of thought and effort into it.
