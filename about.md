I was born and raised in Edison, NJ but moved to NYC to attend NYU; somewhere close but far enough from home. I'll be graduating in May 2023 with a B.A. in Computer Science and I plan to stay in the city for a few more years (I'm not ready to leave)!

### More About Me

When I don't have a screen in my face you can find me cooking/baking, window shopping, taking a long walk, playing with my cat, or working out. I'm currently training for a half marathon (it's been a humbling experience).

# Two truths and a lie[^1]:
1. I have a tattoo of a mushroom.
2. I was in a commercial when I was little.
3. My middle name is Hope.

[^1]: You'll have to ask me in person for the answer
